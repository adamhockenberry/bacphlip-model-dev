The DNA breaking-rejoining enzyme superfamily includes type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine based site-specific recombinases (integrases) that share the same fold in their catalytic domain containing conserved active site residues. The best-studied members of this diverse superfamily include Human topoisomerase I, the bacteriophage lambda integrase, the bacteriophage P1 Cre recombinase, the yeast Flp recombinase, and the bacterial XerD/C recombinases. Their overall reaction mechanism is essentially identical and involves cleavage of a single strand of a DNA duplex by nucleophilic attack of a conserved tyrosine to give a 3' phosphotyrosyl protein-DNA adduct. In the second rejoining step, a terminal 5' hydroxyl attacks the covalent adduct to release the enzyme and generate duplex DNA. The enzymes differ in that topoisomerases cleave and then rejoin the same 5' and 3' termini, whereas a site-specific recombinase transfers a 5' hydroxyl generated by recombinase cleavage to a new 3' phosphate partner located in a different duplex region. Many DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes also have N-terminal domains, which show little sequence or structure similarity.	167	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	2	0.04673994480265684

Mycobacteriophage L5, is a phage isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis. It forms stable lysogens in M. smegmatis and has a broad host range among the pathogenic mycobacteria. L5 encodes gene products (gp) toxic to the host M. smegmatis. Expression of gp79 interferes with the cell membrane or cell-wall synthesis of M. smegmatis, leading to altered cell morphology. It also has a bactericidal effect on E. coli. The N-terminal segment of gp79 (amino acids 1-41) shares sequence similarity with the signal peptide of the D-alanylD-alanine carboxypeptidase of Bacillus licheniformis. This enzyme removes C-terminal D-alanyl residues from sugarpeptide cell-wall precursors and is also a penicillin-binding protein (PBP). The homology of the hydrophobic N-terminal part of gp79 to a PBP (penicillin-binding protein) signal peptide may indicate an interaction of gp79 with proteins or metabolites involved in the peptidoglycan synthesis of M. smegmatis.	51	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0.03134018623803774

Serine recombinases catalyze site-specific recombination of DNA molecules by a concerted, four-strand cleavage and rejoining mechanism which involves a transient phosphoserine linkage between DNA and the enzyme. They are functionally versatile and include resolvases, invertases, integrases, and transposases. Resolvases and invertases affect resolution or inversion and comprise a major phylogenic group. Resolvases (e.g. Tn3, gamma-delta, and Tn5044) normally recombine two sites in direct repeat causing deletion of the DNA between the sites. Invertases (e.g. Gin and Hin) recombine sites in inverted repeat to invert the DNA between the sites. Cointegrate resolution with gamma-delta resolvase requires the formation of a synaptosome of three resolvase dimers bound to each of two res sites on the DNA.

Integron integrases mediate site-specific DNA recombination between a proximal primary site (attI) and a secondary target site (attC) found within mobile gene cassettes encoding resistance or virulence factors. Unlike other site specific recombinases, the attC sites lack sequence conservation. Integron integrase exhibits broader DNA specificity by recognizing the non-conserved attC sites. The structure shows that DNA target site recognition are not dependent on canonical DNA but on the position of two flipped-out bases that interact in cis and in trans with the integrase. Integron-integrases are present in many natural occurring mobile elements, including transposons and conjugative plasmids. Vibrio, Shewanella, Xanthomonas, and Pseudomonas species harbor chromosomal super-integrons.

This domain model summarizes a family of DNA-binding domains unique to bacteria and represented by the Hin protein of Salmonella. The basic HTH domain is a simple fold comprised of three core helices that form a right-handed helical bundle. The principal DNA-protein interface is formed by the third helix, the recognition helix, inserting itself into the major groove of the DNA. A diverse array of HTH domains participate in a variety of functions that depend on their DNA-binding properties. HTH_Hin represents one of the simplest versions of the HTH domains; the characterization of homologous relationships between various sequence-diverse HTH domain families remains difficult. The Hin recombinase induces the site-specific inversion of a chromosomal DNA segment containing a promoter, which controls the alternate expression of two genes by reversibly switching orientation. The Hin recombinase consists of a single polypeptide chain containing a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (HTH_Hin) and a catalytic domain.	42	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0.01920668452998722

Increasing the fraction of ParA-ADP in the cell inhibits cell division, suggesting that this simple nucleotide switch may regulate cytokinesis. ParA shares sequence similarity to a conserved and widespread family of ATPases which includes the repA protein of the repABC operon in Rhizobium etli symbiotic plasmid. This operon is involved in the plasmid replication and partition.	130	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0.005566778912359821

Serine recombinases catalyze site-specific recombination of DNA molecules by a concerted, four-strand cleavage and rejoining mechanism which involves a transient phosphoserine linkage between DNA and the enzyme. They are functionally versatile and include resolvases, invertases, integrases, and transposases. This subfamily is composed of proteins that catalyze the transposition of insertion sequence (IS) elements such as IS607 from Helicobacter and IS1535 from Mycobacterium, and similar proteins from other bacteria and several archaeal species. IS elements are DNA segments that move to new sites in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes causing insertion mutations and gene rearrangements.	134	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	3	0.005316904915174946

Resolvases and invertases (i.e. Tn3, gamma-delta, Tn5044 resolvases, Gin and Hin invertases) in this family contain a C-terminal DNA binding domain and comprise a major phylogenic group. Also included are phage- and bacterial-encoded recombinases such as phiC31 integrase, SpoIVCA excisionase, and Tn4451 TnpX transposase. These integrases and transposases have larger C-terminal domains compared to resolvases/invertases and are referred to as large serine recombinases.

This model summarizes an uncharacterized family of proteins similar to stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, HflK/C (SPFH) and podocin. The conserved domain common to the SPFH superfamily has also been referred to as the Band 7 domain. Many superfamily members are associated with lipid rafts. Individual proteins of the SPFH superfamily may cluster to form membrane microdomains which may in turn recruit multiprotein complexes. Microdomains formed from flotillin proteins may in addition be dynamic units with their own regulatory functions. Flotillins have been implicated in signal transduction, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeleton rearrangement and are known to interact with a variety of proteins. Stomatin interacts with and regulates members of the degenerin/epithelia Na+ channel family in mechanosensory cells of Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrate neurons and participates in trafficking of Glut1 glucose transporters. Prohibitin may act as a chaperone for the stabilization of mitochondrial proteins. Prokaryotic HflK/C plays a role in the decision between lysogenic and lytic cycle growth during lambda phage infection. Flotillins have been implicated in the progression of prion disease, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease and, in cancer invasion and metastasis. Mutations in the podocin gene give rise to autosomal recessive steroid resistant nephritic syndrome.	217	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0.003475096384458278

SNF5 is essential for the assembly promoter targeting and chromatin remodelling activity of the SWI-SNF complex. SNF5 is also known as SMARCB1, for SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily b, member 1, and also INI1 for integrase interactor 1. Loss-of function mutations in SNF5 are thought to contribute to oncogenesis in malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs).	180	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0.0028466515864494614

181	cd16411	ParB_N_like	"ParB N-terminal, parA -binding, domain of bacterial and plasmid parABS partitioning systems. This family represents the N-terminal domain of ParB, a DNA-binding component of the prokaryotic parABS partitioning system. parABS contributes to the efficient segregation of chromosomes and low-copy number plasmids to daughter cells during prokaryotic cell division. The process includes the parA (Walker box) ATPase, the ParB DNA-binding protein and a parS cis-acting DNA sites. Binding of ParB to centromere-like parS sites is followed by non-specific binding to DNA (""spreading"", which has been implicated in gene silencing in plasmid P1) and oligomerization of additional ParB molecules near the parS sites. It has been proposed that ParB-ParB cross-linking compacts the DNA, binds to parA via the N-terminal region, and leads to parA separating the ParB-parS complexes and the recruitment of the SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) complexes. The ParB N-terminal domain of Bacillus subtilis and other species contains a Arginine-rich ParB Box II with residues essential for bridging of the ParB-parS complexes. The arginine-rich ParB Box II consensus (I[VIL]AGERR[FYW]RA[AS] identified in several species is partially conserved with this family and related families. Mutations within the basic columns particularly debilitate spreading from the parS sites and impair SMC recruitment. The C-terminal domain contains a HTH DNA-binding motif and is the primary homo-dimerization domain, and binds to parS DNA sites.

150	cd05481	retropepsin_like_LTR_1	Retropepsins_like_LTR; pepsin-like aspartate protease from retrotransposons with long terminal repeats. Retropepsin of retrotransposons with long terminal repeats are pepsin-like aspartate proteases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	93	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0.0016302240473524822

278	pfam10743	Phage_Cox	Regulatory phage protein cox. This family of phage Cox proteins is expressed by Enterobacteria phages. The Cox protein is a 79-residue basic protein with a predicted strong helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. It inhibits integrative recombination and it activates site-specific excision of the HP1 genome from the Haemophilus influenzae chromosome, Hp1. Cox appears to function as a tetramer. Cox binding sites consist of two direct repeats of the consensus motif 5'-GGTMAWWWWA, one Cox tetramer binding to each motif. Cox binding interferes with the interaction of HP1 integrase with one of its binding sites, IBS5. This competition is central to directional control. Both Cox binding sites are needed for full inhibition of integration and for activating excision, because it plays a positive role in assembling the nucleoprotein complexes that produce excisive recombination, by inducing the formation of a critical conformation in those complexes.	87	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0.001286060633598146

101	cd00303	retropepsin_like	Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases. The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	92	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0.0011810207216986588

189	cd18728	PIN_N4BP1-like	PRORP-like PIN domain of NEDD4 binding protein 1 and related proteins. NEDD4-binding partner-1 (N4BP1) interacts with and is a substrate of NEDD4 ubiquitin ligase (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase). It is also an inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ITCH, a NEDD4 structurally related E3. This subfamily additionally includes NYNRIN (NYN domain and retroviral integrase containing, also known as CGIN1/Cousin of GIN1), and KHNYN (KH and NYN domain containing) protein. N4BP1, CGIN1, and KHNYN proteins are probably of retroviral origin. This subfamily belongs to the Zc3h12a-N4BP1-like PIN subfamily of the PRORP-Zc3h12a-like PIN family, the latter of which additionally includes human PRORP, also known as proteinaceous RNase P and mitochondrial RNase P protein subunit 3 (MRPP3), and Arabidopsis thaliana PRORP1-3. The PIN (PilT N terminus) domain belongs to a large nuclease superfamily. The structural properties of the PIN domain indicate its active center, consisting of three highly conserved catalytic residues which coordinate metal ions; in some members, additional metal coordinating residues can be found while some others lack several of these key catalytic residues. The PIN active site is geometrically similar in the active center of structure-specific 5' nucleases, PIN-domain ribonucleases of eukaryotic rRNA editing proteins, and bacterial toxins of toxin-antitoxin (TA) operons.	127	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0.0010567499654603415

This family includes two orthologous groups exemplified by the transcription termination factor NusB and the N-terminal domain of the rRNA-specific 5-methylcytidine transferase (m5C-methyltransferase) Sun. The NusB protein plays a key role in the regulation of ribosomal RNA biosynthesis in eubacteria by modulating the efficiency of transcriptional antitermination. NusB along with other Nus factors (NusA, NusE/S10 and NusG) forms the core complex with the boxA element of the nut site of the rRNA operons. These interactions help RNA polymerase to counteract polarity during transcription of rRNA operons and allow stable antitermination. The transcription antitermination system can be appropriated by some bacteriophages such as lambda, which use the system to switch between the lysogenic and lytic modes of phage propagation. The m5C-methyltransferase Sun shares the N-terminal non-catalytic RNA-binding domain with NusB.	129	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0.0009161330504122934

177	cd16407	ParB_N_like	"ParB N-terminal, parA-binding, -like domain of bacterial and plasmid parABS partitioning systems. This family represents the N-terminal domain of ParB, a DNA-binding component of the prokaryotic parABS partitioning system. parABS contributes to the efficient segregation of chromosomes and low-copy number plasmids to daughter cells during prokaryotic cell division. The process includes the parA (Walker box) ATPase, the ParB DNA-binding protein and a parS cis-acting DNA sites. Binding of ParB to centromere-like parS sites is followed by non-specific binding to DNA (""spreading"", which has been implicated in gene silencing in plasmid P1) and oligomerization of additional ParB molecules near the parS sites. It has been proposed that ParB-ParB cross-linking compacts the DNA, binds to parA via the N-terminal region, and leads to parA separating the ParB-parS complexes and the recruitment of the SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) complexes. The ParB N-terminal domain of Bacillus subtilis and other species contains a Arginine-rich ParB Box II with residues essential for bridging of the ParB-parS complexes. The arginine-rich ParB Box II consensus (I[VIL]AGERR[FYW]RA[AS] identified in several species is partially conserved with this family and related families. Mutations within the basic columns particularly debilitate spreading from the parS sites and impair SMC recruitment. The C-terminal domain contains a HTH DNA-binding motif and is the primary homo-dimerization domain, and binds to parS DNA sites. Additional homo-dimerization contacts are found along the N-terminal domain, but dimerization of the N-terminus may only occur after concentration at ParB-parS foci."	86	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0.0004289047769055217

Also present in the structure is a two-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet, whose strands are connected by a four-residue 'wing'. During interaction with DNA, helix alpha2 is thought to insert into the major groove, while the wing contacts the adjacent minor groove or phosphodiester backbone. The C-terminal region of Xis is involved in interaction with phage-encoded integrase (Int), and a putative C-terminal alpha helix may fold upon interaction with Int and/or DNA.	72	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	2	0.0003899900155790709

220	pfam02661	Fic	Fic/DOC family. This family consists of the Fic (filamentation induced by cAMP) protein and doc (death on curing). The Fic protein is involved in cell division and is suggested to be involved in the synthesis of PAB or folate, indicating that the Fic protein and cAMP are involved in a regulatory mechanism of cell division via folate metabolism. This family contains a central conserved motif HPFXXGNG in most members. The exact molecular function of these proteins is uncertain. P1 lysogens of Escherichia coli carry the prophage as a stable low copy number plasmid. The frequency with which viable cells cured of prophage are produced is about 10(-5) per cell per generation. A significant part of this remarkable stability can be attributed to a plasmid-encoded mechanism that causes death of cells that have lost P1. In other words, the lysogenic cells appear to be addicted to the presence of the prophage. The plasmid withdrawal response depends on a gene named doc (death on curing) that is represented by this family. Doc induces a reversible growth arrest of E. coli cells by targetting the protein synthesis machinery. Doc hosts the C-terminal domain of its antitoxin partner Phd (prevents host death) through fold complementation, a domain that is intrinsically disordered in solution but that folds into an alpha-helix on binding to Doc.This domain forms complexes with Phd antitoxins containing pfam02604.	95	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1.7852554511714687e-05

KorB, a member of the ParB like family, is present on the low copy number, broad host range plasmid RK2. KorB encodes a gene product involved in segregation of RK2 and acts as a transcriptional regulator, down-regulating at least 6 RK2 operons. KorB binds RNA polymerase and acts cooperatively with several co-repressors in modulating transcription. KorB is comprised of 3 domains, including a beta-strand C-terminal domain similar to SH3 domains and an alpha helical central domain that interacts with operator DNA. In ParB of P1 and SopB of F, the N-terminal region is responsible for interaction with the parA component. However, korB interaction with the RK2 parA-equivalent IncC has been mapped to the central HTH motif.  This family is related to the N-terminal domain of ParB, a DNA-binding component of the prokaryotic parABS partitioning system. parABS contributes to the efficient segregation of chromosomes and low-copy number plasmids to daughter cells during prokaryotic cell division. The process includes the parA (Walker box) ATPase, the ParB DNA-binding protein and a parS cis-acting DNA sites. Binding of ParB to centromere-like parS sites is followed by non-specific binding to DNA (""spreading"", which has been implicated in gene silencing in plasmid P1) and oligomerization of additional ParB molecules near the parS sites. It has been proposed that ParB-ParB cross-linking compacts the DNA, binds to parA via the N-terminal region, and leads to parA separating the ParB-parS complexes and the recruitment of the SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) complexes.

This subgroup includes the CHROMO (CHRromatin Organization Modifier) domain found in Hypsizygus marmoreus TY3B-I_0 protein, a putative TY3/gypsy retrotransposon polyprotein, and similar proteins. The pol gene in TY3/gypsy elements generally encodes domains in the following order: an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase, here the chromodomain is found at the C-terminus of the integrase domain. The chromodomain, is a conserved region of about 50 amino acids, found in a variety of chromosomal proteins, and implicated in the binding, of the proteins in which it is found, to methylated histone tails and maybe RNA. A chromodomain may occur as a single instance, in a tandem arrangement, or followed by a related chromo shadow domain.	49	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	6.423033818076776e-08
151	cd05482	HIV_retropepsin_like	Retropepsins, pepsin-like aspartate proteases. This is a subfamily of retropepsins. The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	87	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0.0

This model represents the most well-conserved core of a set of chromosomal and plasmid partition proteins related to ParB, including Spo0J, RepB, and SopB. Spo0J has been shown to bind a specific DNA sequence that, when introduced into a plasmid, can serve as partition site.

76	TIGR01784	T_den_put_tspse	conserved hypothetical protein (putative transposase or invertase). Several lines of evidence suggest that members of this family (loaded as a fragment mode model to find part-length matches) are associated with transposition, inversion, or recombination. Members are found in small numbers of genomes, but in large copy numbers in many of those species, including over 30 full length and fragmentary members in Treponema denticola. The strongest similarities are usually within rather than between species. PSI-BLAST shows similarity to proteins designated as possible transposases, DNA invertases (resolvases), and recombinases. In the oral pathogenic spirochete Treponema denticola, full-length members are often found near transporters or other membrane proteins. This family includes members of the putative transposase family pfam04754.	270	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	2	
81	TIGR02238	recomb_DMC1	meiotic recombinase Dmc1. This model describes DMC1, a subfamily of a larger family of DNA repair and recombination proteins.

100	cd00217	INT_Flp_C	Flp Tyrosine-based site-specific recombinases (also called integrases), C-terminal catalytic domain. Yeast Flp-like recombinases mediate the amplification of the 2 micron circular plasmid copy number by catalyzing the intra-molecular recombination between two inverted repeats during replication. They belong to the DNA breaking-rejoining enzyme superfamily, which also includes prokaryotic tyrosine recombinases and type IB topoisomerases. These enzymes share the same fold in their catalytic domain containing six conserved active site residues and the overall reaction mechanism. Flp-like recombinases are almost exclusively found in yeast and are highly diverged in sequence from the prokaryotic tyrosine recombinases. They cleave their target DNA in trans with a composite active site in which the catalytic tyrosine is provided by a promoter bound to a site other than the one being cleaved. Thus each active site within Flp complexes is assembled by domain swapping and contains catalytic residues from two different monomers. Two DNA segments are synapsed by the tetrameric enzyme, carrying the nucleophilic tyrosine in each active site with only two of the four monomers active at a given time. The catalytic domain is linked through a flexible loop to the N-terminal domain, which is largely responsible for non-specific DNA binding and isomerization. Its overall fold is similar to the SAM domain fold also found in the N-terminal domains of lambda integrase and XerD recombinase.	410	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	2	
106	cd00619	Terminator_NusB	Transcription termination factor NusB (N protein-Utilization Substance B). NusB plays a key role in the regulation of ribosomal RNA biosynthesis in eubacteria by modulating the efficiency of transcriptional antitermination. NusB along with other Nus factors (NusA, NusE/S10 and NusG) forms the core complex with the boxA element of the nut site of the rRNA operons. These interactions help RNA polymerase to counteract polarity during transcription of rRNA operons and allow stable antitermination. The transcription antitermination system can be appropriated by some bacteriophages such as lambda, which use the system to switch between the lysogenic and lytic modes of phage propagation.	130	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	
107	cd00659	Topo_IB_C	DNA topoisomerase IB, C-terminal catalytic domain. Topoisomerase I promotes the relaxation of both positive and negative DNA superhelical tension by introducing a transient single-stranded break in duplex DNA. This function is vital for the processes of replication, transcription, and recombination. Unlike Topo IA enzymes, Topo IB enzymes do not require a single-stranded region of DNA or metal ions for their function. The type IB family of DNA topoisomerases includes eukaryotic nuclear topoisomerase I, topoisomerases of poxviruses, and bacterial versions of Topo IB. They belong to the superfamily of DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes, which share the same fold in their C-terminal catalytic domain and the overall reaction mechanism with tyrosine recombinases. The C-terminal catalytic domain in topoisomerases is linked to a divergent N-terminal domain that shows no sequence or structure similarity to the N-terminal domains of tyrosine recombinases.	210	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	
114	cd01026	TOPRIM_OLD	TOPRIM_OLD: topoisomerase-primase (TOPRIM) nucleotidyl transferase/hydrolase domain of the type found in bacterial and archaeal nucleases of the OLD (overcome lysogenization defect) family.  The bacteriophage P2 OLD protein, which has DNase as well as RNase activity, consists of an N-terminal ABC-type ATPase domain and a C-terminal Toprim domain; the nuclease activity of OLD is stimulated by ATP, though the ATPase activity is not DNA-dependent. Functional details on OLD are scant and further experimentation is required to define the relationship between the ATPase and Toprim nuclease domains.  The TOPRIM domain has two conserved motifs, one of which centers at a conserved glutamate and the other one at two conserved aspartates (DxD).  The conserved glutamate may act as a general acid in strand cleavage by nucleases. The DXD motif may co-ordinate Mg2+, a cofactor required for full catalytic function.	97	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	
117	cd01176	IPT_RBP-Jkappa	IPT domain of the recombination signal Jkappa binding protein (RBP-Jkappa). RBP-J kappa, was initially considered to be involved in V(D)J recombination because of its DNA binding specificity and structural similarity to site-specific recombinases known as the integrase family. Further studies indicated that RBP-J kappa functions as a repressor of transcription, via destabilization of the general transcription factor IID and recruitment of histone deacetylase complexes.	97	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	2	
133	cd01436	Dipth_tox_like	Mono-ADP-ribosylating toxins catalyze the transfer of ADP_ribose from NAD+ to eukaryotic Elongation Factor 2, halting protein synthesis. A single molecule of delivered toxin is sufficient to kill a cell.  These toxins share mono-ADP-ribosylating activity with a variety of bacterial toxins, such as cholera toxin and pertussis toxin.   The structural core is homologous to the poly-ADP ribosylating enzymes such as the PARP enzymes and Tankyrase. Diphtheria toxin is encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage. Both diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A are multi-domain proteins. These domains provide a EF2 ADP_ribosylating, receptor-binding, and intracellular trafficking/transmembrane functions .	147	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1

This model summarizes proteins similar to stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, HflK/C (SPFH) and podocin. The conserved domain common to the SPFH superfamily has also been referred to as the Band 7 domain. Many superfamily members are associated with lipid rafts. Individual proteins of the SPFH superfamily may cluster to form membrane microdomains which may in turn recruit multiprotein complexes. Microdomains formed from flotillin proteins may in addition be dynamic units with their own regulatory functions. Flotillins have been implicated in signal transduction, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeleton rearrangement and are known to interact with a variety of proteins. Stomatin interacts with and regulates members of the degenerin/epithelia Na+ channel family in mechanosensory cells of Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrate neurons, and participates in trafficking of Glut1 glucose transporters. Prohibitin may act as a chaperone for the stabilization of mitochondrial proteins. Prokaryotic HflK/C plays a role in the decision between lysogenic and lytic cycle growth during lambda phage infection. Flotillins have been implicated in the progression of prion disease, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and in cancer invasion and metastasis. Mutations in the podocin gene give rise to autosomal recessive steroid resistant nephritic syndrome.	110	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1

137	cd03404	SPFH_HflK	High frequency of lysogenization K (HflK) family; SPFH (stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, and HflK/C) superfamily. This model characterizes proteins similar to prokaryotic HflK (High frequency of lysogenization K). Although many members of the SPFH (or band 7) superfamily are lipid raft associated, prokaryote plasma membranes lack cholesterol and are unlikely to have lipid raft domains. Individual proteins of this SPFH domain superfamily may cluster to form membrane microdomains which may in turn recruit multiprotein complexes. Escherichia coli HflK is an integral membrane protein which may localize to the plasma membrane. HflK associates with another SPFH superfamily member (HflC) to form an HflKC complex. HflKC interacts with FtsH in a large complex termed the FtsH holo-enzyme. FtsH is an AAA ATP-dependent protease which exerts progressive proteolysis against membrane-embedded and soluble substrate proteins. HflKC can modulate the activity of FtsH.

147	cd04610	CBS_pair_ParBc_assoc	Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with a ParBc (ParB-like nuclease) domain. This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with a ParBc (ParB-like nuclease) domain downstream. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).	108	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	
149	cd05470	pepsin_retropepsin_like	Cellular and retroviral pepsin-like aspartate proteases. This family includes both cellular and retroviral pepsin-like aspartate proteases. The cellular pepsin and pepsin-like enzymes are twice as long as their retroviral counterparts. The cellular pepsin-like aspartic proteases are found in mammals, plants, fungi and bacteria. These well known and extensively characterized enzymes include pepsins, chymosin, rennin, cathepsins, and fungal aspartic proteases. Several have long been known to be medically (rennin, cathepsin D and E, pepsin) or commercially (chymosin) important. The eukaryotic pepsin-like proteases contain two domains possessing similar topological features. The N- and C-terminal domains, although structurally related by a 2-fold axis, have only limited sequence homology except in the vicinity of the active site. This suggests that the enzymes evolved by an ancient duplication event. The eukaryotic pepsin-like proteases have two active site ASP residues with each N- and C-terminal lobe contributing one residue. While the fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins, retropepsins function as dimers and the monomer resembles structure of the N- or C-terminal domains of eukaryotic enzyme. The active site motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly-Ser) is conserved between the retroviral and eukaryotic proteases and between the N-and C-terminal of eukaryotic pepsin-like proteases. The retropepsin-like family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements; as well as eukaryotic DNA-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. Retropepsin is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl-protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. This family of aspartate proteases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A1 (pepsin A) and A2 (retropepsin family).	109	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	
152	cd05484	retropepsin_like_LTR_2	Retropepsins_like_LTR, pepsin-like aspartate proteases. Retropepsin of retrotransposons with long terminal repeats are pepsin-like aspartate proteases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	91	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	
155	cd10544	SET_SETMAR	SET domain (including pre-SET and post-SET domains) found in SET domain and mariner transposase fusion protein (SETMAR) and similar proteins. SETMAR (also termed metnase) is a DNA-binding protein that is indirectly recruited to sites of DNA damage through protein-protein interactions. It has a sequence-specific DNA-binding activity recognizing the 19-mer core of the 5'-terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of the Hsmar1 element and displays a DNA nicking and end joining activity. SETMAR also acts as a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase that methylates 'Lys-4' and 'Lys-36' of histone H3. It specifically mediates dimethylation of H3 'Lys-36' at sites of DNA double-strand break and may recruit proteins required for efficient DSB repair through non-homologous end-joining.	254	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	
156	cd11602	Ndc10	Ndc10 component of the yeast centromere-binding factor 3. Ndc10 is a multidomain protein conserved in Saccharomycotina that interacts with kinetochore components. This model characterizes the majority of the protein; some family members may have an additional C-terminal domain that is homologous to transcriptional activators (GCR1_C). Ndc10 is part of the centromere-binding factor 3 (CBF3) complex in budding yeast. The CBF3 complex contains four essential proteins, Ndc10, Cep3, Ctf13, and Skp1. CBF3/Ndc10 is essential for the recruitment of the centromeric nucleosome and formation of the kinetochore. The Kinetochore is the large, multiprotein assembly that serves to connect condensed sister chromatids to the mitotic spindle.  Ndc10 forms a dimer and it has non-sequence-specific DNA binding activity via the DNA backbone. Ndc10 also plays an important role in the coordination of cell division. It has been noted that the protein bears resemblance to the tyrosine recombinases (type IB topoisomerase/lambda-integrase).	413	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	2

It contains an acidic hinge region implicated in histone-binding, a non-canonical plant homeodomain (PHD) finger followed by a C-terminal extension of 40 amino acids that is essential for phosphoinositide (PtdIns)-binding. The PHD finger is a chromatin-binding module that specifically recognizes histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and influences V(D)J recombination.	67	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1

FdxN element is excised from the chromosome during heterocyst differentiation in cyanobacteria. This is accomplished by the large serine recombinase XisF (fdxN element site-specific recombinase). The xisH as well as the xisF and xisI genes are required. XisI may function as recombination directionality factor (RDF), and needs XisH which may function as an endonuclease.	107	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1

164	cd16393	SPO0J_N	"Thermus thermophilus stage 0 sporulation protein J-like N-terminal domain, ParB family member. Spo0J (stage 0 sporulation protein J) is a ParB family member, a critical component of the ParABS-type bacterial chromosome segregation system. The Spo0J N-terminal region acts in protein-protein interaction and is adjacent to the DNA-binding domain that binds to parS sites. Two Spo0J bind per parS site, and Spo0J interacts with neighbors via the N-terminal domain to form oligomers via an Arginine-rich patch (RRXR).  This superfamily represents the N-terminal domain of ParB, a DNA-binding component of the prokaryotic parABS partitioning system. parABS contributes to the efficient segregation of chromosomes and low-copy number plasmids to daughter cells during prokaryotic cell division. The process includes the parA (Walker box) ATPase, the ParB DNA-binding protein and a parS cis-acting DNA sites. Binding of ParB to centromere-like parS sites is followed by non-specific binding to DNA (""spreading"", which has been implicated in gene silencing in plasmid P1) and oligomerization of additional ParB molecules near the parS sites. It has been proposed that ParB-ParB cross-linking compacts the DNA, binds to parA via the N-terminal region, and leads to parA separating the ParB-parS complexes and the recruitment of the SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) complexes. The ParB N-terminal domain of Bacillus subtilis and other species contains a Arginine-rich ParB Box II with residues essential for bridging of the ParB-parS complexes. The arginine-rich ParB Box II consensus (I[VIL]AGERR[FYW]RA[AS] identified in several species is partially conserved with this family and related families. Mutations within the basic columns particularly debilitate spreading from the parS sites and impair SMC recruitment. The C-terminal domain contains a HTH DNA-binding motif and is the primary homo-dimerization domain, and binds to parS DNA sites. Additional homo-dimerization contacts are found along the N-terminal domain, but dimerization of the N-terminus may only occur after concentration at ParB-parS foci."	97	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1

The ParB like family is a diverse domain superfamily with structural and sequence similarity to ParB of bacterial chromosomes/plasmid parABS partitioning system and Sulfiredoxin (Srx), which is a reactivator of oxidatively inactivated 2-cys peroxiredoxins.

This sub-family also includes siderophore staphylobactin biosynthesis protein SbnI. 60% of the P. furiosus nuclease activity was retained at 90 degree C, suggesting a physiological role in the organism, which can grow in temperatures as high as 100 degrees Celsius. The protein has endo- and exo-nuclease activity vs. single- and double-stranded DNA, and nuclease activity was lost in methylated proteins prepared for structure solution. This family has a fairly well-conserved DGHHR motif that corresponds to the same structural position as the phosphorylation site (a portion of the ATP-Mg-binding site) of sulfiredoxin and the arginine-rich ParB BoxII of ParB.	72	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1

304	pfam13017	Maelstrom	"piRNA pathway germ-plasm component. Maelstrom is a germ-plasm component protein, that is shown to be functionally involved in the piRNA pathway. It is conserved throughout Eukaryota, though it appears to have been lost from all examined teleost fish species. The domain architecture shows that it is coupled with several DNA- and RNA- related domains such as HMG box, SR-25-like and HDAC_interact domains. Sequence analysis and fold recognition have found a distant similarity between Maelstrom domain and the DnaQ 3'-5' exonuclease family with the RNase H fold (Exonuc_X-T, pfam00929); notably, that the Maelstrom domains from basal eukaryotes contain the conserved 3'-5' exonuclease active site residues (Asp-Glu-Asp-His-Asp, DEDHD). However, the animal and some amoeba maelstrom contain another set of conserved residues (Glu-His-His-Cys-His-Cys, EHHCHC). This evolutionary link together with structural examinations leads to the hypothesis that Maelstrom domains may have a potential nuclease-transposase activity or RNA-binding ability that may be implicated in piRNA biogenesis. A protein function evolution mode, namely ""active site switch"", has been proposed, in which the amoeba Maelstrom domains are the possible evolutionary intermediates due to their harbouring of the specific characteristics of both 3'-5' exonuclease and Maelstrom domains."	215	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
